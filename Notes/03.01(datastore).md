# Data Store

## Latency
  - Latency is the time between each IO request is sent and IO response received

## Persistent data store
  - pick a data structure
  - Map to blocks/buffers
  - Convert representation 


## Appilicaiton
  - Key-value stores: map
  - databases
     - Multiple maps
     - Query/update
 
  - Directories / File System
     - Persistent data store 
     - Two nodes (leaves and sub directory/ sub file system)
  
  - Caches
     - map of url to the page content
     - Eviction policy (certain cases remove some urls)
 
## Extendable Hashing
  - Imagine 4 items hash to the same index bucket
  - Insert: add to block, 
       - if full: if possible -> split
       - else double the table
         if still full => retry split, duoble 
         
         
         
## B-Tree
```
  BTree node {
    long BTreeNode(){return buf, setLength(0)}
    long parent;
  }

```
