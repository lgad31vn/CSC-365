# Serialization, Externalization, Picklines


## Marshalling
  - The process convert a POJO to XML (example)

## Unmarshalling
  - The process convert an XML to POJO


## Serialization 
  - In java, objects created in each class will be wiped off by garbage collector after a running session
  - In order to transfer an object, we need to store it on a disk or send it over a network this is when we need to transform it into a byte stream
  - To transfrom an object to byte stream, that class which the object is generated in needs to implement the interface "Serializable" 
### => Serialization is the process of converting the code Object into a Byte Stream to transfer the Object Code from one application (JVM1) to another app (JVM2)

#### example of serialization

```
public class ValueObject implements Serializable {

   private String value;
   private String sideEffect;

}
```

   - Store file in a .ser extension
```
ValueObject vo1 = new ValueObject("Hi");
FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("ValueObject.ser");
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
out.writeObject(vo1);
out.close();
fileOut.close();
```


## Deserialization
### => Deserialization is exactly the other way around (opposite of serialization) and allows us to recreate an object from a byte stream

  - At each level k, choose lefet/right based on bit K
  - Max levels = max nums of bits
