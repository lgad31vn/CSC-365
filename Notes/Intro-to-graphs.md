## Introduction to Graph

- **Nodes** (also known as Vertices, or just Records or Objects) may have properties (attributes). They are often the contents of data stores, as covered so far in course.

- **Edges** (also known as links, or in some cases just pointers) connect a source Node to a destination Node. Edges represent relations (two-argument predicates). For example if Nodes represent Airports, edge A->B could represent flight(A,B) -- a flight from A to B.



## Graph Traversal

### Depth-first search 
- Using FIFO stack based datastructure

### Breadth-first search
- Using LIFO queue based datastructure
