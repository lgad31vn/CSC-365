# Persistent Data Store


## Block
  - Block is used for a fixed amount of data (typically technically determined) which typically is only part of a whole, e. g. the first 1024 bytes of a file
  - The next block would then also be 1024 bytes long

## Buffer
  - Buffers are chunks of memory used to store data before offloading it to a final destination.
  - Buffer is a piece of memory in which things are collected in order to process them as a whole when the buffer is full (or nearly full)

  - A buffer would accept a certain amount of data from RAM then hit the interupts signal to tell the CPU to stop bumping data, but then drain the data into the secondary device (disk, HDD)
  - After receiving the data in the buffer, the data get transferred to disk from buffer in a single operation.


### Types of I/O buffering techniques:

1. Single buffer:
  - A buffer is provided by the operating system to the system portion of the main memory

2. Double buffer:

3. Circular buffer:

## Caching
  - Caching is a technique which allows users to store data in an area of data so that the processor can grab the data quickly

## Java NIO (new IO)
  - NIO works with channel and buffer
  - buffer helps store a chunk of data before flush it to disk or any other data devices
  - channel is the bridge connect buffer with data store (file, socket, ...)
    - With the old IO, if you want to read a file we need to create a stream (fstream) to connect the file
    - With the new IO, create a channel to connect the file, read data from channel to buffer and process data in buffer


### Channel 
  - Similar to stream in old IO
  - Channel reads and writes in 2 directions, stream can do only one
  - Channel can read and write at the same time
  - Channel needs to read and write FROM a buffer

### Java NIO buffer -- byte buffer
  - Initially, buffer has write mode, call buffer.flip() to flip the mode to read mode
  - .clea() or .compact() to clear buffer
[byte buffer java doc page](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html)

### FileChannel
```
  public static void readFileChannel() throws IOException {
      RandomAccessFile randomAccessFile = new RandomAccessFile(FILE PATH, "rw");
      FileChannel fileChannel = randomAccessFile.getChannel();
      ByteBuffer byteBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(512);
      Charset charset = Charset.forName("US-ASCII");
      while (fileChannel.read(byteBuffer) > 0) {
         byteBuffer.rewind();
         System.out.print(charset.decode(byteBuffer));
         byteBuffer.flip();
      }
      fileChannel.close();
      randomAccessFile.close();
   }
   
   public static void writeFileChannel(ByteBuffer byteBuffer)throws IOException {
      Set<StandardOpenOption> options = new HashSet<>();
      options.add(StandardOpenOption.CREATE);
      options.add(StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
      Path path = Paths.get("C:/Test/temp.txt");
      FileChannel fileChannel = FileChannel.open(path, options);
      fileChannel.write(byteBuffer);
      fileChannel.close();
   }

```


## Object Relational Mapping
  - ORM allows users to interact with the database using object-oriented paradigm
  - Hibernate JPA is a light open-source api for java to interact with the database without using JDBC like the old way

## Data Persistence in Java using JPA
  - JPA provides a mechanism for managing persistence and ORM
  - JPA is considered as a link between an object-oriented model and a relational database system
  - JPA is a specification of Java so it does not conduct any functioning by itself => needs implementation
  - Therefore, ORM tools like ***Hibernate*** implements JPA specification
  - For data persistence, javax.persistence package contains the JPA classes and interfaces
  - To further simplify the persistence programming model:

## Hibernate - A java framework that works like an ORM tool implementing JPA
  - Main feature of ***Hibernate*** is to map Java classes to database tables
  - ***Hibernate*** is an implementation of JPA guidelines
  - Helps mapping Java data types to SQL data types




## DL's lectures
### Pick a data structure (hash, balanced tree)

## Use blocks / buffers
   - data representation
   - primitives
   - string ()
   - references
   - composites
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## alternatives
   - databases
   - Object-relational-mapping
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Random-access media (means you can go to any offset you want [no need to read in sequence])
in Java use File channel and Byte Buffer


## Filechannel.open -- java.nio.FileChannel

  - OpenOptions()
  - Position(long)


## ByteBuffer srs [size of your block]


## Data Representation
  - primatives
  - Strings
  - Reference
  - Competitor? 

  -- Better approach 
   - *serialization* 
   - pickling
   - JSON
   - XML
   - html


### indexFile and DataFile

- indexFile:array (fill it with -1)           
- dataFile:like a table contains data         
     
     - ***init index = key.hashCode() then put the index in indexFile and from the index in indexFile to look up location in dataFile***

## demo code
```
   indexFile = File(location, open("index", read/write)); //
   
   void initialize(init size){
   
      // fill long buffer with -1s
      // with buffer
      
   }
   
   void contains(float key, ByteBuffer buf){
        for (int i = 0 ; i < 8; i++) {
            if (buf.getFloat() == key) {
               return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
   }
   
   
```

```
   class HashBin{
      ByteBuffer buf;
      static final int COUNT_OFFSET = 0;
      static final int FIRST_KEY_OFFSET = 4;
      
      void getCount(){return buf.getOffset(COUNT_OFFSET)}
      
      void getKey(int index){}
   }
```
