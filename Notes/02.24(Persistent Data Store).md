# Persistent Data Store


## Block
  - Block is used for a fixed amount of data (typically technically determined) which typically is only part of a whole, e. g. the first 1024 bytes of a file
  - The next block would then also be 1024 bytes long

## Buffer
  - Buffers are chunks of memory used to store data before offloading it to a final destination.
  - Buffer is a piece of memory in which things are collected in order to process them as a whole when the buffer is full (or nearly full)

  - A buffer would accept a certain amount of data from RAM then hit the interupts signal to tell the CPU to stop bumping data, but then drain the data into the secondary device (disk, HDD)
  - After receiving the data in the buffer, the data get transferred to disk from buffer in a single operation.


### Types of I/O buffering techniques:

1. Single buffer:
  - A buffer is provided by the operating system to the system portion of the main memory
