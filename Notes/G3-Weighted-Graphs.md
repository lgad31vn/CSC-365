- When dealing with weighted graphs, traversal and connectivity algorithms usually have goal of finding not just any solution, but the best one with respect to weights, where weights represent non-negative costs:
  - Shortest Paths: find minimum cost path from A to B, or from A to anywhere (single-source shortest path tree), or single-sink, or anywhere to anywhere (all-source, all-sink)
  - Trees: find the minimum spanning tree (MST), with minimum total cost among chosen edges.
